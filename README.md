# EECS2011A-Fundamentals of Data Structures: Project Starter Kit
This repository provides the starter kit for the EECS2011A course project. The project description can be found here.  

You will create a Java package named ``eecs2011.project``. The [Solution.java](/src/eecs2011/project/Solution.java) 
class is where you implement your solutions. Note that you can define as many as classes you want in the ``eecs2011.project``
package to implement your project; the ``Solution.java`` exposes your implementation to the judge system.

There is an example in the [Sample.java](/src/eecs2011/project/Sample.java) class showing **one possible way** to read input, 
store data, and print answers using standard input and output. You are encouraged to implement your input/output/storage 
methods for better performance.

A sample input is provided by [sample_input](/sample_input).
